# Action Focused Mode

To write an action to make it support focused mode, you should extend abstract class `top.myrest.myflow.action.ActionFocusedKeywordHandler`, like this:

[JavaFocusedActionHandler.java](java-demo-plugin/src/main/java/runflow/JavaFocusedActionHandler.java ':include :type=code')

> `plugin-spec.yml` configuration also like [action](jar-plugin-guide/action.md#action).
